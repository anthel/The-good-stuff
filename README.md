### Remove local changes


<ins>There could be only three categories of files when we make local changes:</ins>


> Type 1. Staged Tracked files

> Type 2. Unstaged Tracked files

> Type 3. Unstaged UnTracked files a.k.a UnTracked files

>> * Staged - Those that are moved to staging area/ Added to index
>> * Tracked - modified files
>> * UnTracked - new files. Always unstaged. If staged, that means they are tracked.


1. ``` git checkout . ``` - Removes Unstaged Tracked files ONLY [Type 2] 

2. ``` git clean -f ``` - Removes Unstaged UnTracked files ONLY [Type 3]

3. ``` git reset --hard ``` - Removes Staged Tracked and UnStaged Tracked files ONLY[Type 1, Type 2]

4. ``` git stash -u ``` - Removes all changes [Type 1, Type 2, Type 3]
